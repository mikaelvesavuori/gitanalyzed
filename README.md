## Therapy for Your Code â€”Â Decode Your Repository's Mind!

GitAnalyzed is your passport to unlocking the psychology of your codebase. GitAnalyzed delivers comprehensive insights that go beyond commits and branches. Discover the dance of file churn, embrace the ebb and flow of line changes, and unravel the story of author contributions. Dive deep into code ownership dynamics, calculate the heartbeat of your development with churn rates, and uncover the pulse of bug fixes. GitAnalyzed isn't just about analytics; it's the therapy your code deserves. Let your repository share its mind, and GitAnalyzed will translate its language into actionable wisdom.

## What to know

GitAnalyzed wraps features readily available in Git, but which might be underutilized by many of us. Indeed there are good commercial tools out there - using GitAnalyzed, however, will provide you with important cornerstone features at no cost, no legacy or dependencies (as it's just plain Git), with very easy-to-inspect results.

**Results are output into a directory named `gitanalyzed` with `.txt` files for each feature.**

## Installation

You can use it just as any old script in a project if you want...

_But the nicer option is to use the `install.sh` script._

It will:

- Make a root level directory named `.gitanalyzed`
- Copy `gitanalyzed.sh` to the new directory
- Add a line to your `.zshrc` with an alias (`gitanalyzed`) that runs the script

Feel free to modify the installation script or do it your way if this doesn't match how you'd like it to be set up.

You will need to source or reload your IDE for the changes to be activated.

## Usage

Easy, just run `gitanalyzed` in a Git repository.

## Contributing

There is a dedicated [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), but generally I'm happy to take suggestions and proposals for new features!
